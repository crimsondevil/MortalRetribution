# Mortal Retribution

Mortal Retribution is designed to be an interactive, objective-based First Person Shooter game. The player, who is acting as a Mortal Avenger, is in a hostile world which once used to be their home planet. It has now been overtaken by an evil robot army that is extremely hostile to all life forms and has eliminated all life on the planet. The robots now stand guard, following the orders of their robot overlords, protecting their newly seized assets. The player spawns into this world, with the goal of avenging his fallen comrades and eradicating the robot army, thereby saving their home planet. There are two main game modes that Mortal Retribution offers: Story (Player vs Environment) mode or Competitive (Player vs Player) mode.
