# C# Networking Tutorial Series
This is the source code for my [C# networking tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXkn83W0QkfnqsK8I0RAz5AbUxfg3bOQ5) on YouTube.

Each branch contains the code corresponding to what you should have at the end of the associated video. For example, the code you have after watching part 5 of the series should match the code in the tutorial-part5 branch.

**Note:** using the console app server in the GameServer project (from any branch) with the GameClient project from branch 6 and up *will produce errors*. This is because after part 5 of the series, we moved the server code into Unity and stopped updating the console server.

**Unity Version: 2018.3.7**
